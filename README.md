### This web application started out as a final project for our Web Programming class (CSCI 4300) at The University of Georiga. After the project was completed, I added some finishing touches to make it responsive and user friendly. The tech stack we used as MongoDB as our database, Express to create a RESTful api, React for the frontend, and Node JS as our backend. We also utilized the poplular frontend framework NextJS to benefit from client side rendering.
